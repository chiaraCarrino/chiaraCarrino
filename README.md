#  üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Chiara Carrino

**`Post-doctoral researcher in Cellular and Molecular Biology - Bioinformatics`**



Hi, I'm Chiara! I am a postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics with a strong background in applied statistics and the analysis of complex biological data. My work involves the daily use of programming languages such as Python and R, which I leverage to extract meaningful insights from large-scale datasets. I am also familiar with HTML and CSS, which I use to support scientific communication and develop interactive tools.

Curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning define my approach to research. I‚Äôm always seeking new challenges that allow me to grow intellectually and contribute meaningfully to the scientific community. I firmly believe in science as a driver of progress and innovation.

My goal is to apply data-driven expertise to high-impact scientific and technological projects that have the potential to create positive social change.

 <summary><h3>‚ú® My path in science</h3></summary>
  I started my academic journey with a degree in biology, which sparked my interest in data-driven approaches to understanding life sciences. I later specialized in bioinformatics through a master's program, followed by a PhD and postdoctoral research, where I refined and consolidated my skills in data analysis, statistics, and computational biology.

Throughout my academic path, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to mentor several students and lead a master's-level course‚Äîexperiences that have strengthened my ability to train others and collaborate effectively in team settings. I enjoy building connections and often find myself acting as a bridge between people with different backgrounds, helping to foster understanding and collaboration.

While my work has primarily focused on biological data, I‚Äôm open to analyzing diverse data sources, especially when they support meaningful, socially impactful projects. Women's health is a field I haven‚Äôt yet worked in directly, but it‚Äôs an area I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about and hope to contribute to in the future.
